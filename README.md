# Unofficial UberSDK for iOS and Mac OS X - Swift

This is an unofficial SDK for the new Uber API released in March 2015. This SDK allows developers to easily use the Uber API without having to worry about implementing OAuth 2.0 or perform any Network Requests.

# Installation Instructions 
Coming Soon. (If you can't wait lookup importing Swift Frameworks into Swift/Objective-C projects depending on what you are using

# Documentation and Usage 
Coming Soon.

- Feel free to fork this repo if you like it. I will be updating this frequently, until all end points are supported.
- If you have a bug to report or want a new feature or a function you think the SDK should give developers access to create a new issue, in the issue tracker.
- If you want to contribute some code (or even some test cases) make a new pull request.
